# Archipelago Hangman (AP Manual)
Hangman is usually a game where players will guess the letters used in a word, and only have a certain amount of guesses to get the word right, else they lose the game. However, this is a version of the game created for Archipelago, so instead of guessing letters for the word, you have to hunt for the letters within the multiworld.

## What Are You Searching For?
The letters. Obviously. You can also find "Early Word Guesses" for multiplayer play, so someone who isn't you can try to guess the word early and allow for an early release.

## Play Guide
#### Warning: Do Not Generate This Game Alone
Given the nature of this manual, there are more locations than items. This is unfortunately kinda unavoidable in a manual form. This also will cause this manual to create generation errors alongside certain games, use at your own patience.

#### How to play
The person in charge of the slot after generating a seed choose a random word (either by generating it via online generator, or by flipping to a random page in the dictionary. or... however you choose to do it.), and then, after you get all of the letters in the word, or someone picks up an early word guess and another payer that's not you guesses the word; you click the victory button.
